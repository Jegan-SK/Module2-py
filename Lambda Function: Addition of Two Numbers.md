# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    f=lambda a,b : a+b
    print(f"Sum of {a} and {b} is {f(a,b)}")

## Result

Thus the python program to define a lambda function which takes two arguments 'a' and 'b' , and returns their sum is written and executed successfully.
